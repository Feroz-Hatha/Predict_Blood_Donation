# Predict_Blood_Donation

Blood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during a major surgery or a serious injury, to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals. In this project, we try to predict whether or not a person will donate blood based on his/her past blood donation history using the Logistic Regression classifier.

Our dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will donate blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.

The data is stored in a text file, `transfusion.data`, and is structured according to RFMTC marketing model (a variation of RFM). RFM stands for Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value and it is commonly used in marketing for identifying your best customers. In our case, the customers are blood donors.
